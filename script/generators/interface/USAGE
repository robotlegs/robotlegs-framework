Description:
    Stubs out a new ActionScript RobotLegs Command class and test case and then
	rebuilds all test suites. Pass the fully-qualified class name, either as a
	shell file target or a dot-delimited string.

	This command uses the Sprout::Generator::NamedBase class which will search
	for configuration parameters as follows:
	
	1) Command line parameters will supercede any of the following.
	2) Search the current working directory and all parent directories 
	   for a valid Rakefile.
	3) If a Rakefile is not found, classes will be created directly from the 
	   current working directory.
	4) If a Rakefile is found, it will be loaded. If the rakefile instantiates
       a Sprout::ProjectModel, that configuration will be used for source and test
       paths, language preferences, and other values.
	5) If no ProjectModel is instantiated in your Rakefile, the Rakefile itself
       will be treated as the project root, and classes will be created from that
       directory.

	You can edit the erb templates that this command uses in a variety of ways.
	If you would like to edit the templates for all projects on your system,
	simply copy the directory at: File.dirname(__FILE__) into: 

	#{SPROUT_HOME}/sprout/generators/
	
	To edit templates for a single project, copy the directory to:

	#{PROJECT_HOME}/script/generators/
	
	Once you have the contents of this package copied, simply edit the files found
	in the templates/ folder to your satisfaction.
	
Example:
    `./script/generate rlcommand com.company.projectname.controller.MyCommand`

	Will create the follow files:
	
	    Class:			src/com/company/projectname/controller/MyCommand.as
	    Test Case:		test/com/company/projectname/controller/MyCommandTest.as

	    Test Suites:	test/AllTests.as
